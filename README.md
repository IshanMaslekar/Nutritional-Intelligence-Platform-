# Nutritional Intelligence Platform Utilizing End-To-End Large Image Model (LIM) for Comprehensive Food Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to create a Nutritional Intelligence Platform that leverages an End-To-End Large Image Model (LIM) for comprehensive food analysis. The platform is designed to analyze images of food to determine their nutritional content, detect adulteration, and provide meal tracking and planning functionalities. By utilizing advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, the platform offers an accurate and user-friendly way to manage and improve dietary habits.

## Features

- **Nutritional Analysis**: Analyze images of food to determine their nutritional content, including calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients.
- **Adulteration Detection**: Identify potential adulteration in food ingredients through detailed image analysis.
- **Meal Tracking**: Track daily meals and nutritional intake to monitor dietary habits.
- **Meal Planning**: Plan meals based on nutritional goals and dietary preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and interactive interface for easy use.
